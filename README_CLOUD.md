sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install PM2
sudo npm install -g pm2
```

### 2. Application Setup

### 4. Nginx Reverse Proxy (Optional)
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pushover Notifications Not Working**
   - Verify your User Key and App Token in `.env`
   - Check Pushover app is installed and configured

2. **No Events Found**
   - Verify artist IDs are correct
   - Check area ID is valid
   - Ensure date range is appropriate

3. **Database Issues**
   - Check file permissions for `events.db`
   - Verify SQLite is working: `sqlite3 events.db ".tables"`

4. **Server Won't Start**
   - Check port 3000 is available
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check `.env` file exists and is properly formatted

### Debug Mode
Set `NODE_ENV=development` in `.env` for more verbose logging.

## üîÑ Updating Configuration

### Adding/Removing Artists
Edit `config.json` and restart the server:
```bash
pm2 restart ra-event-monitor
```

### Changing Location
Update the `areaId` in `config.json` and restart.

### Modifying Check Interval
Update `checkIntervalHours` in `config.json` and restart.

## üìà Scaling Considerations

- **Multiple Locations**: Run separate instances for different areas
- **High Artist Count**: Consider splitting into multiple instances
- **Database Size**: Monitor `events.db` size and implement cleanup if needed
- **API Rate Limits**: The 2-second delay between artist queries respects RA.co's API

## üîê Security Notes

- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
- Use HTTPS in production with proper SSL certificates
- Consider implementing API authentication if exposing the dashboard publicly
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review application logs
3. Verify configuration files
4. Test with the CLI version first

**Note**: This tool respects RA.co's API by including delays between requests. Please use responsibly and don't overwhelm their servers with excessive requests.
